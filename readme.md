## About
This tool helps you remove duplicate lines from your text, with additional text processing options.


## How to use
1. Paste your text into the "Input Text" box on the left.
2. Choose your options:
	- Case sensitivity: Decide if "Hello" and "hello" should be treated as the same.
	- Text case: Choose how the output text should be formatted (original, lowercase, sentence case, or title case).
	- Sorting: Optionally sort the output alphabetically.
	- ASCII only: Remove any non-ASCII characters if needed.
3. Click the "Remove Duplicates / Update" button.
4. Your processed text will appear in the "Processed Text" box on the right.
5. Use the "Copy to Clipboard" buttons to easily copy your input or output text.

The "Mobile Version" toggle allows you to switch to a more compact layout on smaller screens.
